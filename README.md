### Must have extensions

To improve your xp on gnome desktop I strongly suggest some extensions:

- [Dynamic Panel Transparency](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1011/dynamic-panel-transparency)
- [Top Icons Plus](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons)
- [Plank Dock](https://launchpad.net/plank)
